Do you read the bible? Did you hear about the plague turning the water in the Nil into blood? That actually was a red tide caused by these little fellers. When these microalgae form massive blooms, they can give the water a bloody red tint.</p><button>Want to learn more?</button></article>

They are unicellular animals that often host microalgae (mostly dinoflagellates) in their outer surroundings. Due to their calcite shell, they are a major player in the ocean chemistry with respect to ocean acidification.</p><button>Want to learn more?</button></article>
